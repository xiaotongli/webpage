                <h1>December 31, 2019</h1>
                <p><i>Americanah (C. N. Adichie)</i></p>
                <img class="book-cover-img" src="img/books/americanah.png" />
                <p>A beautiful, idealistic love story blended with a heavy dose of harsh, honest realism. What started as a bright-eyed 
                    romance built upon books and fantasies of international futures was later pummeled with the challenges of growing up in a third world 
                    African country, immigrating and starting anew in foreign lands, and adopting and embracing the new identity of being "black". 
                    What better way to experience these challenges than through the thoughts of an outspoken and unabashedly opinionated main character?
                </p>
                <p>For me, the start of this novel was slow, but I was soon entirely mesmerized and captivated, after main character Ifemelu immigrated to America. 
                    Her challenges and struggles were so tangible that it made me ache for her, the changes she encountered in her own life and that she 
                    observed in the life of her Aunty Uju. These hardships truly crush, mold, and harden a person. To see Ifemelu, on the one hand, firm in 
                    resisting change to preserve her cultural heritage and on the other hand, polishing and cultivating an American persona and success of
                    her own made me so awfully proud of her growth, development, and values. This story hits close to home, especially as I am 
                    becoming increasingly more appreciative of my parents' sacrifices in their immigration story to trade for the life I have today. Beyond 
                    immigration, the perspectives on race and identity have been enlightening and powerful as well.
                </p>
                <p>What I love most about <i>Americanah</i> is two-fold: first, excellent in-depth character studies and compelling narrative; and secondly, the 
                    bold delivery of such strong themes and messages within an exquisite and passionate love story.

                <h1>December 21, 2019</h1>
                <p><i>Predictably Irrational (D. Ariely)</i></p>
                <img class="book-cover-img" src="img/books/pi.png" />
                <p>There are two main messages author Dan Ariely wants us to take away from this book about ourselves. Contrary to popular 
                    standard economic assumptions, we are not always rational thinkers. In fact, there are many emotional and societal forces that exert 
                    a lot of power over our behaviors, even though we may not be aware of them. We make all types of mistakes over and over again, 
                    because that's how we are wired to behave. And those mistakes are not always going to fix themselves or be fixed naturally by 
                    market forces. We often believe that the control of our decisions is in our own hands, but that is simply our flawed 
                    perception, and not reality. The key second takeaway though is that this is all okay. We are not helpless. Instead, it is up to
                    us "to be more vigilant, force ourselves to think differently about these decisions, or use technology to overcome our inherent 
                    shortcomings". It is also up to businesses and policy makers to design products and policies in such a way that benefits everyone.                    
                </p>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book, because the messages are delivered in a very actionable way. Not only does Ariely share 
                    enlightening stories and experiments to really drive his points home, he also includes tips and advice on how we can change 
                    the way we behave, now that we are more aware. Below are summarized insights from the different chapters. Check 
                    out his book and <a href="http://www.predictablyirrational.com/">www.predictablyirrational.com</a> for his actionable advice 
                    and to learn more about designing or getting involved with experiments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> We don't have an internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth. Rather, we focus on the relative advantage
                            of one thing over another, and estimate value accordingly. This can lead to a cycle of relativity, where the more we have, 
                            the more we want.
                        </li>
                        <li> We often make an initial decision based on what's available in the environment and then attach ourselves to that initial 
                            decision. Initial decisions help shape future behavior, both for ourselves and others.
                        </li>
                        <li> When something is free, we forget the downside of a transaction. We are intrinsically afraid of loss, but there is no visible
                            possibility of loss when we choose a free item.
                        </li>
                        <li> Social norms are friendly requests where instant paybacks are not required. Market norms are sharp-edged exchanges with 
                            comparable benefits and prompt payments. Where social and market norms collide, trouble sets in. Even just thinking about money 
                            makes us behave more selfish and less like the social animals we are intrinsically. In the long run, social norms will make the 
                            difference.
                        </li>
                        <li> We often substantially underestimate the degree to which passion can change our preferences and the actions we are capable of. 
                            We should educate ourselves on how to deal with high emotions and bridge the gap between our hot and cold states.
                        </li>
                        <li> We often fall in love with what we own and be overly optimistic about anything that has to do with ourselves.
                        </li>
                        <li> We often do anything possible to keep options open and ignore the cost of doing so.
                        </li>
                        <li> In the absence of perfect information, we often look for social cues to help us. Expectations set up in advance then affects our judgment. 
                        </li>
                        <li> We instinctively assume discounted items are lower quality than a full-priced item. 
                        </li>
                        <li> We've become more distrustful, even though the total value to society is maximal when we all cooperate and trust is high. 
                            However, we tend to think about short-term benefits and our own immediate needs. And if one person lies or scams, the distrust is 
                            infectious and everybody loses.
                        </li>
                        <li> When given the opportunity to cheat, many honest people will cheat, but only a little bit. Once tempted to cheat, they are not 
                            as influenced by the risk of being caught. If we are reminded of morality at the moment we are tempted, then we are more likely 
                            to remain honest. Cheating is a lot easier when it's a step removed from money.
                        </li>
                        <li> We sometimes sacrifice our own pleasure for reputational utility.</li>

                <p><i>Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I've Loved (K. Bowler)</i></p>
                <img class="book-cover-img" src="img/books/ehfar.png" />
                <p>One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me in recent months is the finitude of life. This crosses my mind
                    the most when I think of my parents and other loved ones and how I could never have enough time on this earth with them. 
                </p>
                <p>In this memoir, author Kate Bowler captures her experience and thoughts as she becomes unexpectedly diagnosed with 
                    Stage IV colon cancer at the young age of 35, when her career is taking off, her married life is full of bliss, and 
                    her family has newly welcomed a young baby boy. This diagnosis in particular mystifies Bowler as the entirety of her
                    religious and professional training on the prosperity gospel has always preached that as long as you have faith, 
                    God will reward you with security and prosperity. What you give to the world will come back to you like a 
                    boomerang. Life is supposed to be fair: the good should be rewarded and the bad should be punished. 
                    So now that she is punished with cancer and illness, there must have a reason. How has she failed? Why her?
                </p>
                <p>As she struggles to understand the turn of events in her life, she does not find all the answers but instead, learns 
                    to be open and to accept. People of different beliefs may phrase it in various ways (ways that may even sound
                    undermining and belittling, from responders to her New York Times column), but she internalizes at the end of the day to 
                    "stop complaining and accept the world as it is". One last conversation she references at the end of her memoir
                    resonates with me. While she may have become more accepting, it by no means symbolizes a surrender or resignation. 
                    Instead, regardless of how short or unpredictable life may be, how many times "we think we have it locked down and
                    it comes undone ... don't skip to the end".

                <h1>October 1, 2018</h1>
                <p><i>Sharp Objects (G. Flynn)</i></p>
                <img class="book-cover-img" src="img/books/so.png" />
                <p>A parent is a child’s first teacher and probably biggest influencer, regardless of whether we as children 
                    actively strive to follow in their footsteps or whether we stubbornly avoid any remote association to them. 
                    The apple does not fall very far from the tree.  
                </p>
                <p><i>Sharp Objects</i> tells a thrilling, dark, and defiant story about the strong impact parents have on children 
                    and the particular scenario of that impact being disastrously damaging due to intensifying generations 
                    of psychological impairment. Author Gillian Flynn focuses specifically on motherhood. She challenges the 
                    broadly accepted idea that women are innately good and selfless — natural nurturers — by “giving women 
                    permission to be bad,” as an individual and as a mother. In the sheltered, snow-globe-turned-ghost-town 
                    of Wind Gap where most nice women are teachers or mothers, a woman was the last to be suspected of being 
                    the serial killer of two young girls in tragic and ruthless murders. After extensively investigating the 
                    cases and blindly pursuing male suspects, Wind Gap police and residents refused to acknowledge what 
                    could’ve been a deception all along. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flynn stresses that being a good mother is not often as portrayed. Contrary to popular belief, it is not 
                    a skill that reliably kicks in or is awakened upon the welcoming of a child. Sometimes, it doesn’t kick 
                    in fully or at all. Not every women will understand or learn how to care for a child in a healthy way 
                    and also, not every women will make that conscious decision to do so. There are a variety of reasons 
                    why a mother may be challenged in her abilities to care for her child. Sharp Objects raises awareness 
                    of a less common and easily undetectable mental disorder called 
                    <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/munchausen-by-proxy#1">Munchausen syndrome by proxy</a>. 
                    Children who are victims of MSP endure a constant lifetime of abuse from their caretakers for the illusion of 
                    being an attentive and doting parent. These parents intentionally sabotage children’s health by causing 
                    fake medical problems for their own emotional gratifications. It’s sick. It’s sad. It’s puzzling, but 
                    <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/beyond-gypsy-blancharde-when-mothers-harm-their-kids-for-attention-250206/marybeth-tinning-250306/">it happens</a>, 
                    and it’s interesting to discuss and a great problem to shine a scrutinizing spotlight on.

                <h1>September 7, 2018</h1>
                <p><i>South of the Border, West of the Sun (H. Murakami)</i></p>
                <img class="book-cover-img" src="img/books/sotbwots.png" />
                <p>2018 has been a continuation of the Haruki Murakami craze that started last year with <i>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</i>
                    and <i>Kafka on the Shore</i>. They were my first exposure to both his contemporary, realistic fiction 
                    works and his insane, magical realism adventures. This year, I started with <i>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</i>, 
                    then moved onto <i>Norwegian Wood</i>, and now most recently, <i>South of the Border, West of the Sun</i>.
                </p>
                <p>It is broadly known that Murakami's books tend to feature similar themes, with similar characters 
                    and similar imageries. Without fail, <i>South of the Border, West of the Sun</i> also features a confused, 
                    introspective central Japanese male character, who is plagued by a childhood love of the past. 
                    He is a small-town boy, who eventually moves to Tokyo, enjoys swimming, listening to records, and 
                    frequenting jazz clubs, and his lover is a mysterious woman, who has a quiet and enticing beauty, 
                    never manages to connect with anyone else, and eventually develops suicidal thoughts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike his other books though, Murakami deeply explores in this one the ideas of infidelity, selfishness, 
                    and choices and consequences. One of the first traits he introduces about our main characters, Hajime and 
                    Shimamoto, is that they are both the only child in their families, something uncommon during their upbringing 
                    in post-war Japan. Only children are viewed as outcasts, spoiled and standoffish, while children with 
                    siblings are open and less self-centered. While this bonds our two leads, it also isolates them from 
                    their surroundings and additionally attempts to justify the way Hajime treats the other females he encounters, 
                    which his wife Yukiko later calls him out for. Despite how he betrays his first girlfriend to sleep with her 
                    cousin or how he betrays his loving wife and daughters to chase Shimamoto, Hajime continuously plays the victim, 
                    because to him, he is a tormented soul struggling to find his own identity and to re-invent himself. As good as 
                    his intentions may be, he can't escape the ghosts of his past or the uncontrollable forces that come with it. 
                    While he is remorseful of his actions, Yukiko needs to call him out explicitly for his oversight and dismissal 
                    of other people in his life to remind him that he is not the only one dealing with demons.

                <p class="book-quote">
                    "The last few weeks, I really did think I would die... That's how lonely and sad I was... You didn't know that, 
                    did you? You have never seriously given it any thought, have you? What I was feeling, what I was thinking, 
                    what I might do... You don't understand a thing."
                </p>
                <p class="book-quote">
                    "Most likely I don't." I said.
                </p>    
                <p class="book-quote">
                    "And you don't ask anything," she said.
                </p>  
                <p class="book-quote">
                    I opened my mouth to say something, but the words wouldn't come out. She was right: I never did ask her anything. 
                    Why didn't I? I had no idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though Yukiko reassures us that it's not about right or wrong, I still enjoyed the way Murakami juxtaposes what 
                    society deems is the moral code against the irresistible magnetism of natural desires, while simultaneously 
                    battling all this against the passage of time, the accumulation of missed opportunities, and the inevitability 
                    of death and change. Murakami's writing is always a treat and I look forward to reading <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> 
                    before taking a hiatus from his work.
